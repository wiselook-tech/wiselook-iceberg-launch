### Home â€” concise copy

### Hero

- Headline: Discover your talent in minutes, not weeks
- Subhead: Uncover hidden potential with science-backed, conversational assessments delivered natively in your system, ready to deploy and scale. Predictive soft-skills intelligence for succession planning, mobility, and workforce decisions.
- Primary CTA: Let's talk

### Proof and awards

- Winner, HR Innovation Summit â€” Startup of the Year.[[1]](https://www.rrhhdigital.com/secciones/eventos-rrhhdigital/781586/hr-innovation-summit-2025-mas-talento-mas-ideas-y-una-asistencia-record/)
- Academic collaboration and validation
- Industry expertise and implementation

### Problem (Go beyond multipleâ€‘choice tests)

- Headline: Go beyond multipleâ€‘choice tests
- Body: Most assessments only capture the obvious. The real skills, judgment, and potential stay invisible. It's time to see the whole picture.
- Visual: Invisible Talent Pyramid showing three workforce layers (Execs, Best of Workforce, Line Workers) with "Human Skills get tested" and "Human Skills get debated" labels

### Solution (How we solve it)

- Headline: How we solve it
- Intro: A short, conversational flow that captures real evidence and turns it into action.
- Three-step process:
    1. **Assess**: People answer brief, openâ€‘ended prompts in their own words where they already work.
    2. **Analyse**: Responses are evaluated against validated rubrics to surface skills, strengths, and potential.
    3. **Act**: Managers and HR get clear, practical insights to make fair, faster talent decisions.

### Approach and value

- **Adapt to your culture**: Modular building blocks that adapt to each company's model, culture, and values
- **Conversational, inclusive assessment**: AI-powered scale without making technology the headline, focusing on human potential
- **Frictionless scale**: Native in Microsoft Teams drives higher completion and faster time-to-value vs. separate-platform tools
- **Predictive intelligence**: Conversational SJT with psychometric rigor uncovers what people can actually do, not what they self-report
- **Decision-ready insights**: Behavioral levels and readiness signals for succession and mobility, not just skills tags
- **Enterpriseâ€‘grade privacy and security**: Built with security first

### Competitor landscape

- **Heading**: Competitor Landscape
- **Context**: "Why this matters" - Most tools either rely on subjective judgement or don't scale. We combine validated, objective evidence with automation so organisations can make fair decisions at speed.
- **Visual**: Interactive 2Ã—2 quadrant positioning Wiselook in "Objective and High Scalability" quadrant
- **Axes**: X-axis "Objectivity" (Subjective â†” Objective), Y-axis "Scalability" (Low â†” High)
- **Competitors**: Neutral categories - Traditional Consulting, MCQ Assessments, Taxonomy Platforms, HR Suites, Point Tools
- **Positioning**: Wiselook highlighted in top-right quadrant with primary theme color and halo effect
- **Interactivity**: Hover states showing one-line descriptions for each category
